            "I had my wedding this past August (2021) and I could not speak more highly of my experience with Lauren and the work she did to make my wedding perfect. I rented the <em>vintage mirror</em> collection and I was IN LOVE. From the very first phone call Lauren was dedicated to giving us her complete attention to our wedding. She is a signage pro - she made it easy to not have to worry about welcome signs, bar menus, table numbers, card boxes - you name it! We had our final consultation about a month out from the wedding and it was such a fun experience working with Lauren to have my vision come to life. She helped make sure everything was in place and when I called frantically a week before the wedding about needing additional signs, she calmed me down and assured me it would be taken care of - and it was. If youâ€™re looking for a personal touch and a unique experience I highly recommend this company. Lauren is a breath of fresh air with a bubbly personality and she makes you feel confident, excited and goes above and beyond to make things perfect. I am so happy I stumbled upon her business on Facebook. If youâ€™re looking for a sign to use this company for your wedding - do it! (No pun intended ðŸ˜‚)"

            "1000% recommend renting your wedding signs from Lauren! She makes everything customizable to your needs and is amazing to work with. We used the <em>layered arch</em> signs in terracotta and they were absolutely the perfect touch for our big day! She even delivers and helps set everything up! We couldnâ€™t be happier with the outcome of everything."

            "ABSOLUTELY YES!! Lauren was THE best vendor I worked with for my wedding. She was reachable during the entire wedding planning and super sweet!! She kept me included in her design process and often asked for my input and ideas to make it more personable!! I got the <em>arch set</em> and it was BEAUTIFUL. They have so many different signs to mix and match for your needs and style. I got so many compliments on all the different signs and decorations I rented through her!! 10/10 all the way!!"

            "Lauren at Walnut Ridge Wedding Rentals was an absolute DREAM to work with! My husband and I got married at Highfields Event Center in Hudson, OH and she came out to us to set everything up. We went with the <em>Layered Arch pick 6 package</em> and we couldn't have been happier with our decision. Lauren took the difficulty out of the preparation for signage and the product was just outstanding! SO MUCH BETTER than anything I could have printed or designed myself. All of our guests kept commenting on how beautiful it all was. Using Walnut Ridge was a FANTASTIC decision that we would do all over again!"

            "Walnut Ridge Wedding Rentals and the owner, Lauren, did a beautiful job for my daughter's wedding. We chose the <em>vintage collection of mirrors</em> and personalized signage. Everything was elegant, gorgeous and delivered and set-up perfectly. Lauren sent us photos of the finished product a couple days ahead of the wedding to confirm we were pleased. Were were thrilled!  You can trust Walnut Ridge Wedding Rentals to handle your wedding or other event. Our event was at The Event at Sunnybrook in Kent.  The vintage collection added an elegant touch!"

            "The absolute best company to work with! I used the <em>vintage mirror set</em> and the <em>arch</em> for my September wedding in 2020, and let me tell you how amazing they were! Working with Lauren was so easy and simple and they got every detail I wanted on the mirrors. They were willing to work with me when the venues changed at the last minute due to Covid, also. Iâ€™m so thankful I found this amazing company at the Akron bridal show, because they made my wedding pop with the little details they are able to provide! Truly the best! Donâ€™t hesitate, you wonâ€™t regret using them!"
